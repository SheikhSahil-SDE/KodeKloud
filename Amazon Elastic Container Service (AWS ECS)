            What is ECS?
            ECS is a managed container orchestrator like Docker Swarm and K8s. It is provided/managed exclusively by AWS.
            Manage the lifecycle of containers Create/restart/destroy.
            Also responsible for deploy & Load-Balancer across multiple servers
            Autoscaling to handle variance in traffic
            Rolling out newer versions of the application without affecting the user experience.

            ECS vs Others
            Docker Compose can utilize only one server, whereas K8s, Docker Swarm, Nomad by HashiCorp, or Apache Mesos. They all require a lot of effort to get up and running. Complex & hard to work with.
            Whereas ECS is a simple orchestrating alternative.

            ECS Infrastructure and Launch
            ECS has two launch types
            |  |-------- EC2
            |----------- Fargate
