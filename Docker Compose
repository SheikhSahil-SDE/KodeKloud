1. First create a redis database container called redis, image redis:alpine.

      CMD ~ ➜  docker run --name redis -d redis:alpine 
        
        O/P: "redis" container running?

2. Next, create a simple container called clickcounter with the image kodekloud/click-counter, link it to the redis 
   container that we created in the previous task and then expose it on the host port 8085
    The clickcounter app run on port 5000.
    if you are unsure, check the hints section for the exact commands.

    CMD ~ ➜  docker run -d --name=clickcounter --link redis:redis -p 8085:5000 kodekloud/click-counter
    O/P : exposed on the correct HostPort?
          linked to the redis container ?

3. You can now access this application using the Click-Counter tab above the terminal. Refresh the page and see the count increase.

4. Let's clean up the actions carried out in previous steps. Delete the redis and the clickcounter containers.

  CMD : $ docker stop <CONTAINER-NAME> (To stop the containers)
  CMD : $ docker rm <CONTAINER-NAME> (To delete the containers)
  
  CMD : $ docker stop redis
          docker stop clickcounter
        $ docker rm redis
          docker rm clickcounter
        
  O/P:clickcounter container deleted?
      redis container deleted?

5. Create a docker-compose.yml file under the directory /root/clickcounter. Once done, run docker-compose up.
    The compose file should have the exact specification as follows -

    1. redis service specification - Image name should be redis:alpine.
    2. clickcounter service specification - Image name should be kodekloud/click-counter, 
       app is run on port 5000 and expose it on the host port 8085 in the compose file.

    CMD~ ➜  cd /root/clickcounter
            nano docker-compose.yml

                    services:
                              redis:
                                image: redis:alpine
                              clickcounter:
                                image: kodekloud/click-counter
                                ports:
                                - 8085:5000
                           version: '3.0'  
    CMD~ ➜  docker-compose up -d
